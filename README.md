# Color Deck
Color Deck is a color palette collector made for humans. Which makes this all about HSL!
Learn more why [HSL is great](https://github.com/imathis/hsl-picker/).

## Why
There are quite a few color tools out there. However, none focus on HSL. It is arguably the easiest method for humans to view relationships between colors. Many color tools also arbitrarily decide how many colors should be in a palette or series. I set to fix these issues with Color Deck.
